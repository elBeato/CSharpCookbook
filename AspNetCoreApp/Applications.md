Use the STAR approach to talk about my experiance. 

# Vontobel application

# Class String and keyword string
There is no difference between the Class String and the build-in reference type string (keyword).
Differences

| String | string |
| ---- | ---- |
| Class | keyword |
| Import using.System| no import needed|
| data type | keyword|
|Contains methods, properties, etc. | is only an alias for System.String |

btw: using is a keyword, mostly used for include namespaces to my code, e.g.: import System namespace, which is not needed in Visual Studio 

# Keyword using
- Include/import namespaces: using System;
- Resource management: using (var resource = ...) { ... }
