# Give a good impression
- Try to be calm
- Not nervouse and don't do stupid misstakes
- Don't feel like at the blackboard in the school 
- Do some funny jokes
- Try to explain what is your idea
- Talk about important stuff not only bla-bla
- Tell them your good idea

# Workstructure or how to pass a tech interview
How to pass a tech interview needs more a structural working process then to find the solution fast. 
Here are some basic rules how I do my work. 

0. [always do same comments inside the code]
1. Read the question properly and find some constraints and pitfalls. 
1. Ask for some clarification if I don't understand the questions or the exercise.
1. Do some additional examples in with comments in the code-editor. 
1. Split it into easier handle tasks: divide and conquer  
1. Plan my approach: 
	- Do a pseudocode as comments
	- Choose a data structure
	- Design to reorganize the input
	- Find algorthm

1. Think about edge cases:
	- Null values
	- minus or zero
	- wrong input (string instead of number)
	- extrem large dataset
	- duplicates
	- etc.

1. Implement simple bruteforce
	- use for loops
	- if and else

1. Extend features
1. Improve solution
	- Refactoring: Names, clearer structure, be concret,
	- Talk about my solution
	- Clearer coding style
	- Think about possible constraints, they help to add better performence

1. Think about performence issues:
	- for-loops with break and continues
	- cut the array before
	- Think about big O(x)


# Some main consideration
Work according clean code topics: 
- Writing meanfully names
- PascalCase or Camele case
- Avoid magic numbers
- Error handling
- Keep function small and focused
- Use strong typed, create classes
- Don't use to much primitive types
- Avoid side effects outside the function (no global variables)
- Use meaningful arguments as parameters
- Use guards for input validation
- DRY = dont repeat yourself
- Comments should explain why not what
